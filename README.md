# I am the Code Man

My name is Konstantin. I'm a software engineer who is proficent in making software and very technical programming. I am very invested in the topics of Data Science and Computer Science.

The projects I am most proud of are:
- A file encoder that works with binary and follows the principals of an undo button.
- A website used for keeping track of stats in a table-top game, built by request from a friend.
- A program that suggests analgous and complimentary color palletes for any given image.
- A lexer + parser combo that a compiler will later be built upon
- A simple program that helps me simplify writing Data Science code in Jupyter Notebook.
